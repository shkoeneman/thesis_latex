\Chapter{DISTRIBUTION-BASED MODEL SELECTION PROCEDURE}
		In this chapter, we develop a new model selection procedure that leverages the probability distribution of a difference between log-likelihoods. We discuss in detail how
		to implement to procedure using AIC, BIC, or AICc in the case of linear regression.  In addition, we feature a simulation study to illustrate the efficacy of the procedure
		in both prediction and description in the case of variable selection for a linear model, and in the case of correlation structure selection for generalized least squares.
