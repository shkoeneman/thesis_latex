\Chapter{GOODNESS-OF-FIT PROCEDURE FOR LINEAR MODELS}

	The preceding chapter presented a new model selection procedure that relies on the distributional properties of differences in information criteria values to guide
	selection in a manner that does not rely only on rules of thumb. However, for such properties to be justified, it was first required that the largest candidate model
	in a collection of candidate models did not display lack of fit. This section will develop a new goodness-of-fit procedure to be used with normal linear regression
	that can be employed to help justify such an assumption.
