\Chapter{BACKGROUND}
		In this chapter, various likelihood-based information criteria and goodness-of-fit assessments are presented and some of their properties are also briefly introduced.
		These two areas provide the basis for the model selection algorithm and goodness-of-fit procedure that will be presented later in the thesis. Additionally, theory
		related to the likelihood ratio test, robust sandwich variance estimators, and the bootstrap will be touched upon as these constructs will be relevant to developments
		related to model selection and goodness of fit.
